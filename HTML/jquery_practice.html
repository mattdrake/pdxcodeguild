            <ul>Beautiful is better than ugly.</ul>
            <ul>Explicit is better than implicit.</ul>
            <ul>Simple is better than complex.</ul>
            <ul>Complex is better than complicated.</ul>
            <ul>Flat is better than nested.</ul>
            <ul>Sparse is better than dense.</ul>
            <ul>Readability counts.</ul>
            <ul>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</ul>
            <ul>Although practicality beats purity.</ul>
            <ul>Errors should never pass silently.</ul>
            <ul>Unless explicitly silenced.</ul>
            <ul>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</ul>
            <ul>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</ul>
            <ul>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</ul>
            <ul>Now is better than never.</ul>
            <ul>Although never is often better than right now.</ul>
            <ul>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</ul>
            <ul>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</ul>
            <ul>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</ul>
