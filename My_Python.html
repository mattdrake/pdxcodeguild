    <center><p>The Zen of Python:
        <p>Beautiful is better than ugly</p>
        <p>Explicit is better than implicit</p>
        <p>Simple is better than complex</p>
        <p>Complex is better than complicated</p>
        <p>Flat is better than nested</p>
        <p>Sparse is better than dense</p>
        <p>Readability counts</p>
        <p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules</p>
        <p>Although practicality beats purity</p>
        <p>Errors should never pass silently</p>
        <p>Unless explicitly silenced</p>
        <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess</p>
        <p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it</p>
        <p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch</p>
        <p>Now is better than never</p>
        <p>Although never is often better than "right" now</p>
        <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea</p>
        <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea</p>
        <p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those</p>
